# --- Core Application Dependencies ---
ragas               # Core library for evaluating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.
langchain           # Framework for building applications with Large Language Models (LLMs).
langchain-ollama    # Specific LangChain integration for running local models with Ollama.
ollama              # Python client for the Ollama local LLM runner.
datasets            # Used by Ragas to structure and handle evaluation data.
torch               # Deep learning framework, a core dependency for Ragas and embedding models.
nvidia-ml-py        # Python library for NVIDIA GPU monitoring; replaces the deprecated pynvml.

# --- Development & Testing Dependencies ---
dotenv              # Loads environment variables from a .env file for configuration.
pytest              # Powerful framework for writing and running Python tests.
pytest-html         # Pytest plugin to generate HTML reports for test results.
pytest-cov          # Pytest plugin to measure code coverage.

# --- Utilities & Interactive Tools ---
ipython             # Enhanced interactive Python shell, useful for debugging and exploration.
arize-phoenix       # Dependency for Ragas, provides observability and tracing for LLM applications.

# --- Classic NLP & Retrieval Metrics ---
rouge-score         # For calculating ROUGE scores (n-gram overlap).
sacrebleu           # For calculating BLEU scores (precision-focused overlap).
bert-score          # For calculating semantic similarity using BERT embeddings.
scikit-learn        # For classic machine learning metrics like MRR and nDCG helpers.
