0,FactualJudgeAgent,0.995,"The answer is factually consistent with the context and accurate against the ground truth. The slight discrepancy in the Answer Correctness Score (0.99) is due to minor rounding errors, but overall, the answer demonstrates exceptional factual integrity.",1.0,0.9940685658108388
1,FactualJudgeAgent,0.58,"The answer is partially correct, but not entirely faithful to the context. The nucleus does indeed control growth and reproduction, but it also directs other cell activities. Therefore, I must deduct points for faithfulness. However, since the answer is mostly accurate against the ground truth, I will award some credit for correctness.",0.5,0.6617727917575983
2,FactualJudgeAgent,0.89,"The answer is factually consistent with the context, but contains some inaccuracies against the ground truth. The Faithfulness Score of 1.00 indicates that the answer aligns perfectly with the question's requirements. However, the Answer Correctness Score of 0.79 reveals discrepancies between the provided information and the actual characteristics of Python. Specifically, while it is true that Python is a general-purpose programming language, the description as 'high-level' and 'interpreted' may not be entirely accurate or comprehensive. Therefore, the overall Factual Integrity Score is 0.89.",1.0,0.7914064843069064
