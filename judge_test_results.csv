0,FactualJudgeAgent,0.995,"The answer is factually consistent with the context and ground truth, with only minor discrepancies in accuracy (0.01% error). The Faithfulness Score of 1.00 indicates perfect consistency with the context, while the Answer Correctness Score of 0.99 confirms that the answer is accurate against the ground truth. However, a score of 0.995 is awarded due to the negligible discrepancy in accuracy.",1.0,0.9940685658108388
1,FactualJudgeAgent,0.66,"The answer is partially correct, but it lacks precision in describing the nucleus's function. The ground truth states that the nucleus 'directs all of the cell's activities', which implies a more comprehensive role than just controlling growth and reproduction. Specifically, the answer omits the fact that the nucleus directs other cellular activities as well (e.g., metabolism, DNA repair).",0.5,0.6617727917575983
2,FactualJudgeAgent,0.89,"The answer is factually consistent with the context, scoring 1.00 in Faithfulness Score. However, it deviates from the ground truth by 21% (0.79/1.00), as 'Python is a versatile programming language' does not explicitly mention being high-level or interpreted. The final score reflects this discrepancy.",1.0,0.7914064843069064
