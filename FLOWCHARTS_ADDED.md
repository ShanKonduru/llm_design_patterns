# Flowchart Images Added to README

## Date: January 2025

## Summary

Successfully added two flowchart images to the README.md document:

### 1. Tool Usage Flowchart
**File**: `images/tool_usage_flowchart.png`  
**Location in README**: Pattern 3: Tool Use Pattern section  
**Line**: After "Tool Use Pattern Architecture" heading

**Image Reference**:
```markdown
![Tool Usage Flowchart](images/tool_usage_flowchart.png)
```

### 2. Plan and Execute Pattern Flowchart
**File**: `images/Plan_and_Execute_Pattern.png`  
**Location in README**: Pattern 4: Plan-and-Execute Pattern section  
**Line**: After "Plan-and-Execute Pattern Architecture" heading

**Image Reference**:
```markdown
![Plan and Execute Pattern](images/Plan_and_Execute_Pattern.png)
```

## Changes Made

### Before
- Only Mermaid code blocks were present
- No visual flowchart images displayed

### After
- Added image references above Mermaid code blocks
- Images now display prominently in the documentation
- Mermaid code remains available in collapsible details sections for code reference

## File Structure

```
llm_design_patterns/
├── images/
│   ├── llm_as_a_judge.png
│   ├── llm_as_a_jury.png
│   ├── tool_usage_flowchart.png      ✅ NEW - Added to README
│   └── Plan_and_Execute_Pattern.png  ✅ NEW - Added to README
└── README.md                          ✅ Updated with image references
```

## Benefits

1. **Visual Learning**: Users can see the flowcharts directly in the README
2. **Better Understanding**: Visual diagrams make complex patterns easier to grasp
3. **Professional Appearance**: Images enhance documentation quality
4. **Dual Format**: Both images (for viewing) and Mermaid code (for editing) available

## Placement Strategy

Both images are placed:
- **Above the Mermaid code blocks** for immediate visibility
- **Below the pattern architecture heading** for logical organization
- **Before the examples section** to provide context first

## Image Details

### Tool Usage Flowchart
- Shows dynamic tool selection process
- Illustrates 4 available tools (Calculator, WebSearch, DateTime, CodeInterpreter)
- Demonstrates flow from user prompt to final response
- Color-coded for visual distinction

### Plan and Execute Pattern
- Shows task decomposition process
- Illustrates sequential step execution
- Demonstrates result aggregation and synthesis
- Clear multi-step planning workflow

## Verification

✅ Tool Usage Flowchart image added to README  
✅ Plan and Execute Pattern image added to README  
✅ Duplicate heading removed (Plan-and-Execute Pattern Architecture)  
✅ Images properly referenced with relative paths  
✅ Mermaid code blocks preserved in collapsible details  
✅ All existing content maintained

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to add more flowcharts in the future:
1. Create the flowchart image (PNG format recommended)
2. Save it in the `images/` directory
3. Add the image reference in README.md using: `![Alt Text](images/filename.png)`
4. Keep Mermaid code in `<details>` tags for reference

## Notes

- Image paths use relative references: `images/filename.png`
- This works for GitHub, GitLab, and local markdown viewers
- Alt text provided for accessibility
- Mermaid code blocks still available for those who want to modify diagrams
